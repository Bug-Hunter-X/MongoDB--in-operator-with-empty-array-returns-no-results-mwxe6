# MongoDB $in operator with empty array
This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue with MongoDB's `$in` operator when used with an empty array.  The query unexpectedly returns no results, even if the field is expected to be matched.

## Bug Description
When using the `$in` operator with an empty array, the query returns an empty result set, regardless of the data in the collection. This behavior may not be intuitive to developers unfamiliar with this specific edge case.

## Solution
The solution involves checking if the array used with `$in` is empty. If empty, use a different approach like `$exists` or modify the query logic to accommodate an empty array scenario.
